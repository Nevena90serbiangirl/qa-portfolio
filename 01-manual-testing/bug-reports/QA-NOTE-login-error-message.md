## QA Note – Login Error Message Handling

This scenario was tested to verify whether the system displays an error message
when incorrect credentials are entered during login.

### Test Data
- Email: testuser@test.com
- Password: wrongpassword123

### Observed Behavior
An error message is displayed:
"There was a problem with your login."

### Conclusion
The issue described in the original test scenario could not be reproduced.
The system behaves as expected by providing clear feedback to the user.

This confirms that login error handling is implemented correctly.
