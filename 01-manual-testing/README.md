# Manual Testing – Authentication Module (Login & Registration)

## Overview
This project demonstrates manual testing of an authentication module, focusing on **login and registration functionality**.  
The goal is to validate core business logic, input validation, and error handling from a QA Engineer perspective.
Basic security-related scenarios, such as brute-force protection, were also evaluated from a QA perspective.


This module was tested as part of a QA portfolio aimed at **Junior QA / Internship positions**.

## Test Artifacts
This folder contains the following QA documentation and artifacts:

- **Test Plan**  
  Defines testing scope, approach, risks, entry/exit criteria, and responsibilities.

- **Test Cases**  
  Detailed manual test cases including:
  - Preconditions
  - Test steps
  - Expected results
  - Priority

- **Bug Reports**  
  Documented defects with:
  - Clear reproduction steps
  - Expected vs actual results
  - Severity and priority
  - Supporting screenshots (where applicable)
  - This module covers manual testing of the Login functionality, including functional, validation, usability, and basic security scenarios.  
Test cases, bug reports, and QA notes demonstrate real-world QA practices such as defect identification, verification, and differentiation between actual bugs and expected behavior.  
The focus is on clear documentation, reproducibility, and quality-driven analysis.

## Testing Types Performed
- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing
- Positive & Negative Testing
- Boundary Value Testing
- Exploratory Testing

---

## Sample Test Scenarios
- Valid login with correct credentials
- Invalid login with incorrect password
- Login with empty fields
- Registration with already registered email
- Password validation (minimum length, special characters)
- Error message verification

---

## Defect Reporting Approach
All identified defects are documented using a standard bug report format including:
- Title
- Environment
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Severity
- Priority

This ensures clear communication with developers and efficient issue resolution.

---

## Notes
This project represents **QA thinking and documentation style used in real-world projects**.  
It focuses on clarity, traceability, and practical testing scenarios rather than academic examples.
