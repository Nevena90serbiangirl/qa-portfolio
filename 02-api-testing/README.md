## Covered scenarios

- POST request for login functionality
- Response validation using Postman test scripts
- Status code and response structure verification

## APIs used
- **Reqres API** (login and users endpoints)
- **JSONPlaceholder API** (GET posts)

> Note: Some Reqres endpoints are protected by Cloudflare and may return 403 responses when accessed via API clients. This behavior was identified and documented as part of the testing process.
